# ledstrips
LED strips lightshows for stage design (including analog listener).

### Monochrome LED strips
* **classico.ino** Flagship design: it listens music with analog inputs and lights on sound amplitude peaks.
* **oppo.ino** Independent to analog input: it only switches light from a strip to the other.

### RGB LED strips only
* **parade.ino** Designed for Rone â€” Parade track.


## Tasklist
* Create a controller connected to the algorithms to allow a light engineer to control the lights.
* Use low-pass and high-pass components in order to split music depending on its frequencies to enhance song analysis.
